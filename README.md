# Overview
 
This repo contains the projects completed for the Udacity Full Stack JavaScript nanodegree program. Each project is geared towards a specific skill / application.

## Project 1: Create an Image Processing API with Node
* Follow middleware documentation to use middleware to create an API
* Write relevant unit tests with Jasmine and SuperTest to improve code quality and refactoring
* Utilize TypeScript to avoid errors and improve maintainability
* Accessing the provided URL with image information resizes an image and saves it to disk on first access, then pulls it from disk on subsequent access attempts
* Prettier and Lint scripts should run without producing any error messages.

## Project 2: Create a Storefront API with Postgresql and Express 
* Create a postgres database and connect to it from the Node API
* Design a basic relational database through tables, columns, and simple relationships between tables
* Write well formed and correct SQL queries to select, update, delete, and where information
* Update a database to demonstrate usage/application of migrations
* Secure important information by adding salt to user passwords
* Create CRUD endpoints for models in the application
* Set up JWT tokens in the API using modern authentication methods

## Project 3: Angular Ecommerce Storefront
* Scaffold and configure a single-page application with Angular
* Create a logical hierarchy of components
* Collect input from the user using controlled form elements and Angular events
* Use Angular event bindings
* Create and use custom TypeScript models
* Use decorators to pass data between parent and child components
* Use a service to pass data between sibling components
* Use Angular routing in templates

## Project 4: Host a Full Stack App
* Set up AWS RDS for the database, AWS ElasticBeanstalk (or alternatives like lambda) for the API, and AWS s3 for web hosting
* Trigger a successful pipeline on each push to the main branch
* Write a proper pipeline file using the config.yml format used by CircleCi
* Configure secrets via the Continuous Integration software
* Write code that demonstrates a well-organized docs folder
* Prepare an architecture diagram to document the deployment flow
